# ORB Feature-Based Slam

## What is SLAM?

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a technique used in computer vision and more precisely in robots to explore unknown environments and map what the robot sees meanwhile it doesn't lose track of its position on the map that's creating. The input generally used are radars and Lidars, but in this case the input is just a video of a highway with lots of trees for feature extraction. The method for extracting the features is the opencv ORB method.
